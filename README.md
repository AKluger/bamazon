A virtual store exhibiting inventory tracking and dynamic updates from user input

### Project Overview
This project mimics a virtual store.  The client interacts with prompts in the command-line interface and based on their input, the store database will be updated.  All of the store product information is stored in a database built with mySQL.  * The customer app allows a customer to view products and purchase.  
* The manager app allows one to either:
* List a set of menu options:
* View Products for Sale
* View Low Inventory
* Add to Inventory
* Add New Product


### Technologies Used:
* Node.js
* mySQL
* Javascript
